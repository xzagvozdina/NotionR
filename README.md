3) You may need to run RStudio as administrator to install packages correctly (https://ru.wikihow.com/%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BD%D0%B0-Mac-%D1%81-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8-%D1%81%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F).
